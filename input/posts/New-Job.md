I started a new job a few weeks ago. I now have a title of Software Engineer which I feel is more expressive of what I feel that I do. The company is awesome and have been supportive of me. I also feel that everyone is just as excited as I am about being there. I have some new inspiration and I hope to introduce a few projects that will be useful for others. I may also migrate to a new domain that is a little more reflective since I am not doing much spatial development in my new position.

# Getting my MSCE

I am gearing up to start my journey toward getting my MSCE in [Cloud Platform and Infrastructure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcse-cloud-platform-infrastructure.aspx). I am planning to take a stranger approach. I have always wanted to grow my infrastructure and operations knowledge. I have been in the DevOps space, knowing enough operations to be effective at assisting an Ops team, but never knowing enough to be okay alone. With that said, I plan to get my [Network+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network) certification first as it will help with settings up VNETs in Azure. I few years ago I started studying for my [Linux+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/linux) certification, but I never took the test. That previous studying has serendipitously set me up for the path that I am going to take. 

I am going to start with my MSCA in [Linux on Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-linux-azure-certification.aspx). That will require me to get my [LFCS](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfcs), then take one additional course that I am pretty familiar with already. After that, I will only need to take one exam, more than likely it will be [70-535: Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-535.aspx).  So my path looks like this:

* Network+
* LFCS
* 70-533: Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions
* MSCA: Linux on Azure
* 70-535: Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions
* MSCE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure

I am super excited to get started. This is also a safe bet to say that most of my blog posts will be related to how I am studying or using the new knowledge. I think this will make me a stronger developer and architect.

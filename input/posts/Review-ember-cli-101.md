I have posted a couple of times about my frustration using Ember. I was about two weeks in using EmberJS when I finally got to a point that I just did not know how to proceed. I was having difficulty connecting all the dots and embracing the “Ember Way”, which I feel is critical to really getting the most out of Ember.

While beign frustrated I started looking for any material that could help me along. However, most materials are either older versions of Ember or do not use Ember CLI. Finally, I discoverd the book [ember-cli 101](https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101) by [Adolfo Builes](http://blog.abuiles.com/). I purchased the book and all I can say is, wow. This book really helped me and I was able to start connecting the dots that made Ember start clicking in my head. That is what has gotten my in this flury of blog posts about Ember, I somewhat get “it” now.

There is still plenty to learn, but I feel like I have been spring boarded to a great start by reading this book. He also offers a course to occupany the book. I was unable to attend the first offering, but plan to take it if offered again. It is a tremendous value that is being offered, and I hope that anyone you give it a try finds it just as helpful as I have.

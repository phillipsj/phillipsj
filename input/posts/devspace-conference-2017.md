# DevSpace Conference 2017

This past weekend I attended and presented at my first [DevSpace](https://www.devspaceconf.com). I had the pleasure to present on one of my favorite topics, Cake! The conference is in the beautiful town of Hunstville, AL. There are plenty of activities for the family with the [Space Center](https://www.rocketcenter.com/) being one of the primary. I haven't been to Hunstville since middle school and it is amazing to see how the town has grown. 

The accomdations where nice and the event center was nice too. The DevSpace team put a lot of work into the event and it showed. The speaker selection was nice and relevant for the region. I am definately putting this one on the list for next year. 

It also helps when there is excellent BBQ close. A group of us went to [Big Bob Gribson BBQ](http://www.bigbobgibson.com/locations/) on 6th Ave, Decatur, AL. I would highly recommend it and would like to see this become a DevSpace tradition.

My slides can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/17JOyirNYOzbj) for those interested.

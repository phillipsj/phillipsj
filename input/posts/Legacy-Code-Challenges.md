In preparation for my new job, I started reading “Working Effectively with Legacy Code” by Micheal Feathers. So far I am finding the book really informative and definately openining my mind. I was just given a legacy project that currently needs some work. I have yet to start writing many tests, but I do have some in place. I look forward to trying many of these new techniques and I am finding that it is helping me learn more about design and design patterns. Hopefully I get more on role with blogging.

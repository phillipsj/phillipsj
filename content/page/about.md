Hello, my name is Jamie Phillips.

I am a Senior Cloud Engineer, and I work remotely from East Tennessee. I have been working with .NET since 2007 after discovering .NET development in graduate school. My Geology degree has given me an appreciation for large systems and processes which has created keen interest in Solutions Architecture, DevOps, and the Cloud. During the day I work on Windows, but at night I am all about Linux.

I have profiles scattered around the web at the following sites:

I attended PyTennessee a couple of weeks ago.  This is the fisrt one of what I hope is many.  I took some photos of the talks that I attended. I meet some great folks while at the conference and a few key community members that I have been wanting to meet.  We had the former and current chair for PyOhio there and I am looking to attend it in July.  I took some photos of the event, but I am still learning to use tinkerer and I may need to submit a pull request to get this to work or create an extension.

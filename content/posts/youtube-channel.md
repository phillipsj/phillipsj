# YouTube Channel

I have been wanting to communicate some ideas that I have and start sharing information differently. I plan to continue blogging, but I wanted to start creating videos, so I started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKGt52ca8BvLTgDP5KIKzCA). If you like what I have been doing here on this blog, please check out my channel. I have just started, and my primary focus right now is discussing topics and ideas around DevOps. I do plan to add some tutorials, but that is a few more videos down the road.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

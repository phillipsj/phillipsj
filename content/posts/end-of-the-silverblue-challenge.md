I ended the two-month challenge a couple of weeks ago. I successfully used it for two months and I don't have any complaints. Installing flatpaks for desktop applications was a breeze and leveraging toolboxes for working with CLI applications didn't pose any significant issues. I guess the big question is, will I be sticking with it? The short answer is no, I won't be. I like the concept of an immutable OS and I think that I want to see what some of these other projects are bringing to the table. I'm pretty excited about checking out [VanillaOS](https://vanillaos.org/) and [openSUSE MicroOS Desktops](https://microos.opensuse.org). After having given Gnome another good attempt, I keep finding myself wanting KDE features and applications. There are just applications in the KDE space that I really enjoy and often they don't feel the same on a Gnome desktop. With that said, I'm right now running on KDE Neon until I find a good KDE distro that I enjoy using.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

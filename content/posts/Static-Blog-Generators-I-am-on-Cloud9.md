I am a big fan of using a static blog generator. I don’t have to worry, about security, database, or hosting. This blog is powered by [Tinkerer](http://tinkerer.me/) which is an extension built on [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), Sphinx is primarily used to create documentation for Python projects, but is really useful in general for lots of things.

One issue I have come across with most static blog generators is that most have a depedency that doesn’t run well on windows, not a issue normally, but I have been moving back to the windows ecosystem lateley. Another complaint/issue is that you can’t just edit the blog without sitting at your computer or a computer you own.

To get around both of these issues and to test out working in the cloud, I decided to give [Cloud9](https://ide.c9.io) a try to see how I like it. So far all I can say is that it’s awesome and works great. I started this post on my desktop and now I am working on my laptop without needing to run a git pull because it’s in the cloud. Now I am finising this post on my desktop, yet again a seamless transition. The autocomplete provided by their editor is nice and they have a dark theme. You can also preview any html you are working on in a browser inside the editor. I have yet to try [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io), but so far I am pleased with what Cloud9 has to offer.

After this experience, the allure of a Chromebook is growing as I think that I could really get by just using a cloud based stack. Yes, it does require connectivity, but if you really think about it, when was the last time you felt productive without connectivity.  I know that I don’t at all.

Thanks, for reading.

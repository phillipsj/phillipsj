# Parts ordered for the Cluster

I ordered the parts today that I want to use to build my cluster. Amazon sent a very encouraging email today with some
of the items being on sale and a large increase in rewards. I decided that there wouldn't be a better time so I jumped.

Here is what I ended up order.

* 3 x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
* 3 x Samsung MicroSD EVO 32GB
* Anker PowerPort 6 with 6-pack of 1ft Micro USB Cables
* HobbyMate 180Pcs M3 Nylon Standoffs

## Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

I decided to go with the Pi 3 Model B. It wasn't a large cost increase, but the processing and memory was, so I went
with the Pi 3 Model B.

## Samsung MicroSD EVO 32GB

I didn't need 32GB cards, but these were offered at the same price as the smaller ones. The speed is 95 MB/S which is a
faster card, so that made the choice really easy.

## Anker PowerPort 6

After readying around most tutorials seem to use a 60W hub. Scott Hanselman used this hub to build his cluster.
Honestly, the fact that it comes with 6 Micro USB cables included makes is a steal.

## HobbyMate 180Pcs M3 Nylon Standoffs

I didn't need anything fancy at this point in time. These will get the job done until I decide that I need something
more official looking.

Well that is it. Once the parts are in, I will take pictures and started posting the other decisions that I need to
make. Thanks for reading.

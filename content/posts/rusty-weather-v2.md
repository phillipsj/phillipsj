# Rusty Weather V2

It's been just a tad over a year since I created my post on the app I used to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) called [Rusty Weather](https://www.phillipsj.net/posts/rusty-weather-my-first-rust-app/). Since that time I have learned a few new things about Rust, not as much as I would have liked. My Rust journey has taken several detours with me diving into other things and then the pandemic just sapping my desire to really learn anything. I have rediscovered the joy of writing Rust and decided to revisit Rusty Weather by updating the techniques that I used and adding testing.

## Original Design

Originally when I created Rusty Weather, I just sat down and created as basic of a port as I could have an existing Python application. I did implement a few rustisms, but I hand't yet taken the time to really learn the better techniques. I am now ready to update the application to leverage these new approaches and see if I can make it an even cleaner application.

I thought it would be fun to document what I find in tech that currently interests me. This way, I can look back and see the trajectory of my interests. I will break these into two categories, personal and professional. Personal interests may not have any bearing direct bearing on my career, while professional ones do.

## Personal Interests

I will start with my personal interests since I spend more time focusing on these. These are in no particular items. This will include languages, frameworks, and open source projects I would like to contribute.

* Rust
* QML/Qt Quick
* KDE
* Plasma Mobile

It's hard to stay focused on these, yet fun to dabble in all of these.

## Professional Interests

Professionally, my interests are a little more focused on where I see my current job opportunities. I started out as a dev, then DevOps, moved into management, then to an architect, back to doing cloud engineering/site reliability engineering. This will more than likely be reflected in those interests.

* Go
* Kubernetes
* Linux
* HashiCorp Nomad

It's hard to be a user of HashiCorp products like Terraform and Packer or an interest in cloud-native tech without knowing a little Go. Actually, everything on this list is Go related except Linux. More and more tools in Linux are being written in Go too, so there is that. 

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

# Cake: Developing Addins Part 5

After a little bit of deliberation I have finally finished the [Cake.Netlify](https://github.com/phillipsj/Cake.Netlify) addin. I decided to only implement the *Deploy* command as that is the command I am most interested in using. I ask that you go to the MyGet feed referenced in the GitHub repo and try out the beta version. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please submit an issue in the repo.  I will work on making some more tweaks to the Cake file before I push to NuGet.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

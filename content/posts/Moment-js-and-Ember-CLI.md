Moment.js is not inlcuded by default with Ember-CLI, so if you want to create a helper to generate beautifully formatted dates, then you need to make sure to install the ember-cli-addon for it.

Here is the command:

```
$ npm install --save-dev ember-cli-moment
```

You will also have to update your jshintrc to inlcude “moment” in the predec section. However, I just discovered the ember-moment addon that creates helpers for you to use so you do not need to create your own.

```
$ npm install --save-dev ember-moment
```

You can check both out on ember addons website [here](http://www.emberaddons.com/#/?q=moment), the link takes you to all packages that involve moment or you can search by the names in the commands above.

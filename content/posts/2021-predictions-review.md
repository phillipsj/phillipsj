Time to review my [2021 predictions post](https://www.phillipsj.net/posts/2021-predictions/). This year I didn't do well at all except where I partially got just one of them. Let's get into it.

## Microsoft Windows Desktop Environment for Linux

Not much to say, if Microsoft had made one everyone would have known. 

**Score: 0**

## Microsoft Open Sources SQL Server

I was sure we would have seen soemthing like this to answer some of the pressure. However, we didn't.

**Score: 0**

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be Free

Again, I mostly missed this one. There are is a free tier based on size and revenue which is why I am giving myself half a point. However, this was not what I had thought it would be.

**Score: 0.5**

## Windows Server becomes Free

Not much to say or add to this one either. I totally missed it too.

**Score: 0**

## Conclusion

## Final Tally 

My total score was 0.5 points. I am already working on my next set of predictions, and I will get those posted soon.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

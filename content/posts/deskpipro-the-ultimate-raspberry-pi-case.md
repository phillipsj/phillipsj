I have been wanting to make better use of my [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) since I have been using my home lab a lot more. The one issue that I normally have with the Pi and most other single board computers is the storage performance. EMMC storage is better than and SD card, yet both are not close to SATA 3 SSD performance as I would like. After looking around for options, I first tried using an NVMe USB 3.0 enclosure, which worked wonderfully, albiet, the enclosure would heat up to the point you couldn't really hold it.

I have been wanting to make better use of my [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) since I have been using my home lab a lot more. The one issue that I normally have with the Pi and most other single board computers is the storage performance. eMMC storage is better than a SD card, yet both are not close to SATA 3 SSD performance as I would like. After looking around for options, I first tried using an NVMe USB 3.0 enclosure, which worked wonderfully, albiet, the enclosure would heat up to the point you couldn't really hold it. I wasn't comfortable with it being that hot so I decided to look for other solutions. 

After doing some research I found the [Argon ONE M2](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-m-2-case-for-raspberry-pi-4.html) and the [DeskPi Pro](https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-pro-for-raspberry-pi-4). Both cases provide plenty of nice features like active cooling, M2 SATA SSD support, and full size HDMI. I would be happy with either case and I have heard many positives things about both. After some careful consideration I decided to go with the DeskPI Pro. The ability to use both M2 and normal SATA SSDs is an advantage along with having the up draft cooler. With all of this covered, let's get into the review.

## Packaging

It arrived very well packed and once opened, there was no damage on the box. The packaging is nice with a detail.

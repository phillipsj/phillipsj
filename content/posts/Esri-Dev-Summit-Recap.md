I made it back from the Esri Dev Summit. Dodge ball did not work out so well as we went out in the second round. However, the [keynote](http://video.esri.com/watch/3223/social-coding-and-the-future-of-open-source) by Chris Wanstrath was great and a keynote that was definately needed at an Esri conference.

My presentations went really well and both were well recieved.The highlight was when a member of the File Geodatabase API team, who also supports SQLite attended. It was great
having a member of a team to show interest in your presentation and participate in a Q&amp;A session.  Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback, it was appreciated. Also a big shout
out to Amy Niessen of Esri for coordinating all the user presentations.

Last, but not least is the exciting features and new SDKs coming. The [QML](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtqml/qtqml-index.html) SDK looks really promising and will provide organization that cannot afford to create apps using the native SDKs a cross-platform solution. The new .NET SDK is a welcome step forward as now only the XAML needs to be different to support desktop, store, and phone. The disconnected story has improved and there are lots to cover there.

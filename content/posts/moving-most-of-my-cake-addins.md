# Moving most of my Cake Addins

I just wanted to post up that I will be moving a large majority of my Cake Addins into the [Cake Contributions](https://github.com/cake-contrib) organization on GitHub. This is going to be both a great move for all consumers and for me. Moving to the organization takes all infrastructure management off me and also allows others to assist when I am not available.

I have noticed recently that lots of people seem to really dislike Dojo. I have no clue as to why. Dojo was an early adopter of a lot of new techniques and technologies. I would agree Dojo has a steep learning curve and it is a large framework with lots of parts. Dijits are awesome and do provide a nice modular way to build parts of the application. The other big item in Dojo is that two of the default themes are accessible. I will agree it is a large enterprisey framework, but if you remove that it is not all that bad.

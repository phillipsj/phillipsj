It has been a few months since I installed [Manjaro ARM Sway Edition](https://manjaro.org/download/) on my [Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/). It has taken since then to really think about the experince. I don't use my Pinebook Pro often and oddly enough, I am able to pick it up and remember how to use [Sway](https://swaywm.org/). I find Sway intuitive which was my largest concern trying to use it and that just isn't the case. I have been able to consistently remmber what to do and how to use it. So I wouldn't let the tiling aspect of Sway or i3 deter you from trying to use it. 

Since this is just a really lightweight window manager that is using [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) it is super efficient and light on resources. The Pinebook Pro boots up very quickly and there is no lag in the user interface when using and launching applications. That is a stark difference compared to full desktop environments that I have used prior. Prior desktops have included Xfce, KDE, and Mate all in various distros like Armbian and Manjaro.

I will be keeping Manjaro ARM Sway Edition on my Pinebook Pro for now unless I decide to try out i3 just to see how it compares.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

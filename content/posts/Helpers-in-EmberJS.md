EmberJS uses Handlebars as its template engine. To extend it, you create what Ember calls helpers. There are several ways in Ember to tackle a problem, but some are more optimal than others.

I needed to create tags that use the **mailto** and **tel" attributes. So achieve this I created helpers so my templates are a little more semantic to read and understand what is happening.

The first helper I created was a mailto helper. Using Ember-CLI is a nice way to get started. Remember that helpers kind of require a multipart name, so make sure not to create one with a single name as it tends to generate errors in EmberJS. Another tip is to make sure that you wrap your html tag in the Ember.Handlebars.SafeString method so it doesnâ€™t escape the html when rendering.

Getting Started:

Lets create the mailto helper to start.

'''
$ ember g helper mailtoLink
'''

Now navigate to the helper file and add this code.

```
import Ember from 'ember';

export function mailtoLink(input) {
   var mailTo = '<a href="mailto:' + input + '">';
   mailTo += input + '</a>';
   return new Ember.Handlebars.SafeString(mailTo);
}

export default Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper(mailtoLink);
```

Now create the telLink helper to start.

'''
$ ember g helper telLink
'''

Now navigate to the helper file and add this code.

```
import Ember from 'ember';

export function telLink(input) {
  var tel = '<a href="tel:' + input + '">';
  tel += input + '</a>';
  return new Ember.Handlebars.SafeString(tel);
}

export default Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper(telLink);
```

Now to use these you can just call these in your templates like so:

```
<p>Email: {{mailto-link email}}</p>
<p>Phone: {{tel-link phone}}</p>
```

Ember makes lots of things really easy, but sometimes it not very clear how to do others. 

Hope you find this helpful.

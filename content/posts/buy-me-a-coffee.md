# Buy me a coffee

I have created a [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/aQPnJ73O8) site based on feedback. If you find any of my OSS projects or the content I create on my blog valuable, you now have an additional way to encourage me to continue with what I am doing. The interactions on Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and in person are why I do this, and I enjoy every single one. A few have expressed wanting the ability to support these efforts financially. I previously had a Patreon page configured, but due to their policies, I have removed that page. I have set my page to take any charges out of the donations. I have also enabled one-time and monthly options.

Thanks for reading my posts, using my OSS, and all the encouragement that provided. I have big plans for this coming year, and my posts will pick back up in February.

I have been looking at the gear that I use every day. I try to re-evaluate the equipment every couple of years to decide if I need or should make a change. Buying an office chair from a professional brand was the first big choice that I have made, and that was almost ten years ago. Ever since that decision, I have made purchases over the years to boost ergonomics or quality of life. Recently, I have decided to give my keyboard and mouse a review. I have been using a [Logitech M510](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m510-wireless-mouse.910-001822.html?crid=7) for years. I have more expensive mice from them. However, I really like how it feels, and the weight is perfect for my preferences. Many of the ergonomic mice are very expensive, and since I didn't know if I would like it, I decided to dip my toes in with a more economical but quality ergo mouse. After searching, I discovered that the [Anker Vertical Mouse](https://us.anker.com/products/a7852) was reasonable. I have been impressed with the price and quality of Anker products owning several of them over the years. I felt confident that it would be a good experience.

## Packaging and Visuals

Like all Anker products, it comes nicely packaged with an eye for detail. The overall look of the mouse is pleasing. Here are some photos of the packaging.

## Initial Impressions

Overall, I really like it. I have been using it for almost two days now, and I notice a difference in my house hand. It feels less tired at the end of the day, and my neck feels less tense. The vertical nature did take some adapting, which occurred quickly for me. After just a few hours of using it, accuracy improved, and I didn't find it awkward anymore. Only time will tell if it's something that I decide to stick with.

## Gripes

I really only have two gripes with the product, which both can be considered personal preference. The first gripe is that it's very light. I like my mice to have a little weight, and this one doesn't. I feel most probably want a lightweight mouse, so it could be a good fit for many. The other gripe is that the surface wasn't as grippy as the Logitech. However, on the second day, I didn't notice it as much.

## Conclusion

I am glad that I made the purchase, and I plan to stick with it for at least an entire month. At the end of that month, I will post back with my impressions.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

Starting in April I'm going to start a [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) challenge for two months. I'm going to do blogging, DevOps work, and .NET development using it. I'm going to have to put [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) and [Toolbox](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/) through the paces to see if I can make it work for me. As a daily driver doing normal tasks, I'm positive Silverblue is going to work great. It's the other items that I'm not fully convinced will work. The plan is to blog two to three times a week throughout the challenge to share my findings and what I learn. I encourage anyone reading this to give it a too.

Thanks for reading,

Jamie

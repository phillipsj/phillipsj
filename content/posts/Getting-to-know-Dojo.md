I have been wanting to dive into Dojo for sometime, but I have always let the new fancy frameworks lure me away. I have a draft post about Angular gueued up right now, but I have been working with Dojo recently and it seems every time I work with it, I come across some feature that makes me think, WOW! Dojo has several features that everyone raves about in other frameworks. Dojo was one of
the first adopters of AMD, it has templates, a widget framework, charts, mobile ui, dijits, and the list can keep going.  I am going to make it a point to learn Dojo since it is the backbone of Esriâ€™s JavaScript API and it is unavoidable if you are doing Esri based GIS development. It also appears that Dojo is now starting to implement mapping based on OpenLayers.

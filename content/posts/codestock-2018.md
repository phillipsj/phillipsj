# CodeStock 2018

CodeStock just keeps getting better. This was my fourth year attending and speaking and I had an excellent time. I was able to catch up with old friends and make new ones, the opening keynote by Paige Bailey and the closing keynote by David Neal were great. Both talks really bookended the conference very well. The session selection was great and there was a session for everyone that attended. Sessions had a nice blend and it was great to see a few more than usual on data science. 

As far as speaking goes, I had a blast. This year was a little different as speaker feedback and head count was provided by the conference. This was a welcoming addition as gathering feedback and getting a head count always add stress. 

My first session was on *Responsible App Tailoring* which had roughly 30 attendees from my count. My slides can be found [here](). Overall, the feedback that I received in person was great. Here are the shots that I gathered from that session.

And another with the room.

My second session was on *Extending the .NET CLI* which had 15-20 in attendance, again my count. My slides can be found [here](). This was didn't work out as expected and needs a little more work. The overall impression and feedback as that it was useful information. Here is a shot from that one.

If you haven't had a chance to attend, I would recommend you put it on your calendar for next year. It is a good conference and a great place to submit your first proposal.

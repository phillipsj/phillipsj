Just published a new package called [Cake.Ftp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Ftp/). It is a very basic FTP client that allows you to upload or delete files in your Cake script. Please feel free to open an issue in the [repo](https://github.com/phillipsj/Cake.Ftp) if there any features you would like to see added.

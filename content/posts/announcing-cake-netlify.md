# Announcing Cake.Netlify

Just published a new package called [Cake.Netlfiy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Netlify/), which works with the great hosting over at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  Currently there is only support for deploying websites, but more functionality will be added as request or as PRs are submitted.  Here is the link to the [repo](https://github.com/phillipsj/Cake.Netlify).

I was lucky enough that my company sent me to [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/). CodeMash is a pretty awesome conference in Sandusky, OH at a huge indoor water park. There was lots of great content, events, and people. I really enjoyed getting to meet various developers, many of whom I have followed as they are developers that have been influential on my career either through there open source work and material that they have authored. Also I realize that I need to start trying to use social media more than I currently do, so know I can be found on Twitter [@phillipsj73](https://twitter.com/phillipsj73). I am planning to go to CodeMash 2016 and I hope meet even more new developers and reconnect with the developers that I had the pleasure to meet this year.

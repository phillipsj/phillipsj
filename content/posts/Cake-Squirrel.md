Just published a new package called [Cake.Squirrel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Squirrel/). It integrates [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) into the Cake pipeline so you can now create your Squirrel package using Cake.

Still a little work left to do, I would like to add a fluent API, so keep checking back.

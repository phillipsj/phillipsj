Since yesterday’s post I have spent two full days of frustation while working on the Ember app that I am building. I am finding it very difficult to do what I would consider straight forward
things, such as searching and displaying an edit view. I know that that I am just not thinking the “Ember Way” and hopefully I can get on board before too long. I will say that I am still amazed
at how much of the application I have created by just defining models, routes, and templates. I think that I am super productive, just frustrated because it is not clicking. My biggest complaint goes back to what most projects end up doing, which is showing an example, but not in the context of how you would actually do it building an architected application.

Later

I attended my [local](http://lopsaetenn.org/) [LOPSA](https://lopsa.org/) meetup. The presentation for the night was about “Software-Defined Networking”. It was presented by Andy Cowell of the Scripps Network which owns HGTV and FoodNetwork to name a couple. With I had more developer focused meetups, but I think I will keep attending. Next meeting is about disaster recovery at the University of Tennessee.

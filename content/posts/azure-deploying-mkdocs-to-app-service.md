# Azure: Deploying MkDocs to App Service

[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is an great tool to use to build project documentation. My team at work has been using it to create system documentation, consisting of user guides, features, etc. We may look to start using [Wyam](https://wyam.io/) for this in the future, for now, MkDocs has served us and it works on Windows with minimum fuss. As with all of our newer sites, we are hosting on Azure using App Service, with the minimum amount of traffic our documentation receives, free or shared plans work the best. 

I am going to walk you all through how to configure the App Service and the continuous deployment feature that is present. So here goes:

**I will use the term *blade*, that refers to the panels that slide out in Azure.**

## Step 1:  From your Azure Subscription click on *App Services*.

## Step 2:  Add on the App Services blade.

## Step 3:  A new blade will open, click on Web App.

## Step 4:  Click *Create*.

## Step 5:  Creating the site.

A new blade will open, enter requested fields. I like to group my resources together by function, but feel free to add to an existing one if you want. I selected a free plan that I already had created. I am also going to turn on *Application Insights* to provide me some analytics. Finally, click *Create* and you should get a notification that it is being deployed.

Now that you have deployed App Service, it is time to navigate to it and start wiring it up for deployments. Click on the *Deployment Options* and then click on configure, pick the source control option that you are using and follow the prompts.

With that now out of the way, it is time to get to the fun part. Azure uses a tool called [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu) to drive deployments for Azure App Services. So we are going to create a Kudu file for the application that will be checked into the repository. This Kudu file will use the python that is already configured to build our app, then we will use a Kudu command to copy the compiled site to the folder that deploys it.  

So the first thing we are going to do is to create a *.deployment* file. The first couple of lines is going to tell Kudu which folder to deploy. We have to run the compile of the MkDocs so we will need to define a custom deployment script.

```
[config]
command = deploy.cmd
```

Now we need to wire up installing MkDocs and running the build command. We need to create a custom *deploy.cmd* file that we want to execute. Luckily, we can use the Azure CLI tools to generate the basic template for python. 

Put the command line tools in ASM mode.

```
azure config mode asm
```

Now generate the *deploy.cmd* with the following command.

```
azure site deploymentscript --python
```

Below is the script with some modifications. I changed the the script to build in the repository folder and moved the kudu sync closer to the end so I only get the static site copied. I then added step 4 which runs the mkdocs build.

```

```

Another nice addition since I am using a bootstrap them is to setup a custom web.config file for the static assets.  Create a file in your root called web.2.7.config and add the following contents. **Note that the 2.7 in the name refers to the version of python you are using.**

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <staticContent>
    <remove fileExtension=".woff" />
    <remove fileExtension=".json" />
    <remove fileExtension=".mustache" />
    <mimeMap fileExtension=".woff" mimeType="application/font-woff" />
     <mimeMap fileExtension=".json" mimeType="application/json" />
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".mustache" mimeType="text/html" />
  </staticContent>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

With all of these items in place you should be able to use the deployment feature in Azure App Services to build and deploy your MkDocs created website.

Thanks for reading.

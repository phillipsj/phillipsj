[Pode](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/) is a PowerShell based web framework that I learned about recently. After a little investigation, it really seems to be a more tradtional style web framework that is conventiently written in PowerShell. There is a view engine for rendering HTML templates, it can serve up assets like CSS and JavaScript, and the application structure is familiar. Before I start walking through creating an application, my initial thoughts are that this is more geared toward those familiar with existing web development frameworks. This means there is a little more that might be needed to learn and that there is more resources to learn it.

This is also the time to clarify why I keep exploring these frameworks. My background is as a developer that has migrated into DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Site Reliabitliy Engineer. I am very comfortable with any programming langauge and can use most to build an API or website. The one thing that I have learned is that isn't true for a lot of people that are comming into these areas from a non-developer background. Tools like Bash, PowerShell, and Python are heavily used within these fields due to the nature of the work that relies on PowerShell modules, shell scripting, and automation libraries produced by vendors in Python. These are all approachable langauges for most that work in tech and frameworks like Pode, Polaris, UniversalDashboard, etc. allow people who have built skills in these languages to build small web APIs and websites to solve very specific problems. I don't feel these are intended to really compete with the typical list of web frameworks that are often used and not really aimed at the developer market.

So I made this [post](http://www.phillipsj.net/blog/html/2015/02/26/authorize_net_dpm_helper.html) a couple of weeks ago about how to wrap the Authorize.NET SDK into a better form to make it easier to integrate with ASP .NET MVC. So I decided to take it the next step and I created a NuGet [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AuthorizeNet.Helpers/) for it, which can be found here. The [source code](https://github.com/phillipsj/authorize-net-helpers) is up on GitHub under an Apache license. I have also hooked it up to [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/) to build anything pushed to master and deploy the update to NuGet. AppVeyor is really cool and super easy to use. I have mostly used TeamCity and Jenkins, but many of these new services make it even easier. Hope everyone finds this useful, please feel free to open any issues for improvements or suggestions and I will try to make them. If you have anything you would like to contribute please let me know.

When I first started using Ember-CLI I did not pods. Recently I started creating all new code usings pods. It was really weird at first to use them as the conventions seemed strange and confusing.
Items in the editor would show up with the same name and I couldn’t immediately find the file I was needing. However, as time has passed, I am really starting to like it and I am finding that the way it is organized really makes sense. I am finding files faster, I am not getting confused in Brackets as to which file I am editing. Configuring pods couldn’t be easier. Just follow the directions on the ember-cli site and if you want to fully commit then make sure to toggle the use by default settings.

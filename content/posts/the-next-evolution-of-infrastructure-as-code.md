If you have spent anytime with me through conference talks, blog posts, or at meetups you know that I have been a big fan of infrastructure as code, IaC, and that I have focused a lot of effort on Terraform as that solution. I think it is still a great tool for what it does and would be a value add for many teams. There has been efforts over the last couple of years that have been changing my thinking about IaC. Are tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), or the like the final destination? The teams at [System Intiative](https://www.systeminit.com/) and [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/) would suggest that it isn't and I agree. I don't think the current approach is the final place we want to be, I think we have real problems to solve in this space and that we shouldn't become complacent with solutions that may not solve all issues.

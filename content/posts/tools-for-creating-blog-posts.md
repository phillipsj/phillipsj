# Tools for Creating Blog Posts

While I am waiting for an answer from support about a blog post I am working on, I decided that I should write up a post about the tools that I use to create my posts. I do work, both on Windows and Linux, so there are a few differences in tools, but I keep the tooling really similar.

## Screenshots

I like to take all kinds of screenshots, so a tool that gives me the ability to select an area, a window, or full screen is nice. I also like my screenshot tool to be able to do some light editing and markup. This makes it quick to get what I need to be done. 

### On Windows

On Windows, I use the fantastic [Greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org/) tool. It is an OSS tool that works really well and provides nice markup and editing capabilities. It is installable using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), this allows automation of configuring your box.

### On Linux

On Linux, I have tried several different tools. The [XFCE screenshooter](https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/xfce4-screenshooter) tool is pretty nice, it doesn't provide the markup and editing capabilities I need. [Shutter](http://shutter-project.org/) has been a good tool and has the functionality that I like, yet it isn't available for Ubuntu 18.x currently. This leads me to try [Deepin Screenshot](https://www.deepin.org/en/original/deepin-screenshot/) which has been my favorite tool. It is available in the Ubuntu repos and is easy to use.

## Image Editing

It is laughable that I am writing about doing image editing as this is out of my wheelhouse. I do need to blur some data and resize images so I have a need. I have found that I really enjoy one specific tool and it is available on Windows as [Paint .NET](https://www.getpaint.net/). On Linux, the [Pinta](https://pinta-project.com/pintaproject/pinta/) was heavily inspired by Paint .NET and feels just like it. This tool provides most of the functionality that I would use from Gimp or PhotoShop so that is why I use it.

## Image Optimization

Since I am creating images for a blog and I would like to keep the performance of my site up, I use image optimization on my images. It is always a good practice to use these compression tools in tandem with your photo editor. I have found I can always save an additional percentage even after optimizing in a photo editing tool.

### On Windows

On Windows, I use [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) to perform the task. It isn't the newest of tools, but it works for my needs.

### On Linux

On Linux, I use [Trimage Image Compressor](https://trimage.org/) to do it. I stumbled upon this tool and it behaves similarly to PNGGuantlet. So far it has been meeting my needs.

## Conclusion

This is just a quick post listing out what I am using to make content for my blog. I am planning to get into more types of content so there will be a follow up to this one in the future.
